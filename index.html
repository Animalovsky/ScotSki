				<p>CairnGorm Mountain is the most popular snowsports destination in Scotland and has been offering snowsports for over 50 years. It has 30km of ski runs, 11 lifts, a fully maintained freestyle park and an onsite Snow School that caters for everyone, from beginners to experts.</p>
				<p>The snowsports season typically runs from December through until April, but this varies from year to year depending on weather. You don’t have to have your own ski or snowboard equipment either, because you can hire everything you need on the mountain itself – including outer clothing.</p>
